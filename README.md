# MusicArt

Web Page where you can search and sing the **Song** of your favorites **Artists** and at the same time read him/her biography. 

I used for the Stack for this project **HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## API:

I used two API:

1. [AUDIO DB](https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php): For the biography of the artist.
2.   [lyrics.ovh](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#reference): For the lyrics of the song.
